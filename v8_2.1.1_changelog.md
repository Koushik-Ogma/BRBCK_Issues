# Change Log
**Version 8.0 build 2.1.1**

### Content
- [Camera Live Modifiers](#camera-live-modifiers)
- [Sticker Placement](#sticker-placement)
- [Feed - Sound Problem](#feed---sound-problem)
- [Feed - Share](#feed---share)
- [Misc](#misc)

## Camera Live Modifiers
Swiping up the view finder in the camera or tapping on the little arrow icon at the center-top of the screen opens Live Modifiers at the bottom. Provided options are: 1. Timer, 2. Text, 3. Multicapture (TBD when multiple media is supported) 4. Stickers/Emojis/gifs (not animated ATM).
## Sticker Placement
Stickers and Text can now be placed in camera. Here the attachments are added to the captured image and hence those are getting fixed. In case of videos the attachments are unavailable from camera since it requires so much extra time and work.
## Feed - Sound Problem
Sound playing when navigating to and from other screens has been resolved. The video is paused when navigating away and plays from the beginning when returned to Feed.
## Feed - Share
Media (Image and Video) can now be shared like before. A link with the media is sent to the receiver which opens the post in post details view.
## Misc
**Notification for Feed and Discover**
Tested and observed that notifications are appearing (at least in dev mode). If you are still having problems please let us know. Make sure selected state is same for the devices in case of Discover.
